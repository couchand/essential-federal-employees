essential federal employees
===========================

a chart of the levels of so-called "essential" employees, broken down
by department, during the 1995 and 2013 government shutdowns.

built using d3.

based on a chart by Emma Roller on [Slate](http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/09/30/percent_of_essential_federal_employees_in_1996_vs_2013.html).

data guessed from that chart.  forgive me for errors.  i'm lazy.
